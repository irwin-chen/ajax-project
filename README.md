A web application for home cooks that want to use up leftover ingredients

I've always had issues with leftover ingredients after cooking home meals and have used sites before with a similar idea - typing in a list of leftover ingredients and getting recipe ideas for them. I thought it'd bâ€ºe a fun challenge to use the Spoonacular food api and try to replicate the functionality of these other sites.

This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as utilizing AJAX to create a more responsive webapp. The Spoonacular API was used to retrieve the info needed for the project.
